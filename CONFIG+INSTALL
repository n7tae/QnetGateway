Creating a hotspot based on a Raspberry Pi or a BeagleBone Black that can connect to
XRF and DCS reflectors as well as XREF reflectors based on QnetGateway software is
easy.

Start with a Raspberry Pi with the latest Raspbian image (see http://raspberrypi.org)
or most any other computer with the latest Debian-based image. For this latest version
of QnetGateway requires the c++ compiler of at least version 4.9.

Even if you are building an MMDVMHost-based hot-spot, the executables and their
source code are very small, so you can get away with a system with minimum storage
capacity. We have build gui-less versions on two gigabyte partitions! You don't need
to overclock the RPi for QnetGateway, the default clock rate is just fine.

If you are using a DVAP Dongle, a DVRPTR_V1, an MMDVM modem or connecting to an Icom
Terminal and Access Point enabled radio, login and plug in your device to see if the OS
is recognizing it. The MMDVM modem will either plug right onto the Raspberry Pi header,
or with an appropriate adaptor, it can be plugged into a USB port. The kernel should
auto load drivers and you will see that with the "lsusb" command. The DVAP and the Icom
radio digital-to-serial cable uses a FTDI chip and the DVRPTR uses Atmel. If you don't
see an appropriate output from "lsusb" after your device is plugged in, you need to
enable it by executing:

sudo depmod
sudo modprobe <YOURDEVICEMODULE>

where YOURDEVICEMODULE is "ftdi_sio" for the DVAP or is "cdc_acm" for the DVRPTR.
After a reboot you should see the device in the "lsusb" list. If you don't see
the device listed, QnetGateway software will never be able to open it either.

You will need several packages to build the QnetGateway gateway. You will probably
already have all or most of these but it still doesn't hurt to be sure:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install make g++ unzip git wget

One package you probably don't have, but will need:
sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev

If you are building a QnetGateway + MMDVMHost system, please use the instructions
in the MMDVM.README file in order to setup and start your MMDVMHost.

If you are building a QnetGateway for an Icom repeater, you'll need a different
git repository. Please look for QnetICOMGateway.

If you are building an MMDVM, DVAP, DVRPTR_V1, using an MMDVM modem but don't need
any mode besides D-Star or you are using an ICOM Access Point or Terminal Mode
gateway, start by cloning this repository.

git clone git://github.com/n7tae/QnetGateway.git

This will create a QnetGateway directory with everything you need to build your
Gateway system.

The first thing to do is change to the build directory with "cd QnetGateway" and then
define and create your configuration file, qn.cfg:

./qnconfig

This will start a menu driven script. In this mode, only the most common, useful
parameters are available. If you want access to absolutely every parameter use:

./qnconfig expert

Please be sure you know what you are doing if you change these normally hidden parameters.
The configuration script will show you the default value for a parameter. For most cases
the default value is fine, so your qn.cfg file will usually be rather small.

At a minimum, you need to specify an IRCDDB login (please use your legal callsign) and
at least one module. By convention, specify a 23cm module on A, a 70cm module on B and
a 2M module on C. QnetGateway supports a maximum of three modules.

The configure script will show you the default values of every parameter the
QnetGateway programs use. In most cases, the defaults are just fine and you don't
need to override them with your own values. If you need to override the default value,
the general method is to type the key followed by the new value. If you want to delete
an overridden value, type a "u" followed by the key you want to unset. Boolean values
(true or false) can be toggled by just entering the key.

By default, QnetGateway will only connect to the IPv4 QuadNet server at ircv4.openquad.net.
QnetGateway is capabile of dual-stack operation and can also connect to the IPv6 server
at ircv6.openquad.net. If you want to operate in dual stack mode, enter the IRC sub-menu
and set ha to "ircv6.openquad.net" and hb to "ircv4.openquad.net".

Once your operating in dual-stack mode, any routing will prefer an IPv6 address, if
available. It's that easy.

For a DVAP Dongle or a DVRPTR V1, there are some parameters that must be specified,
like the serial number. The two "inverse" parameters for the DVRPTR will probably
have to change. If you don't hear traffic on a connected system, try toggling the
dvrptr_inverse_rx parameter. If you aren't heard, toggle the dvrptr_inverse_tx
parameter. For the DVAP Dongle, or if you are using an MMDVM modem without
MMDVMHost, you need to specify the operational frequency. You also need to make
sure the device address is correct for the MMDVM modem. "Hats" connected to the
Raspberry Pi header can usually be found at /dev/ttyAMA0 while device plugged into
a USB port are usually at /dev/ttyUSB0.

If you want to use the closed-source, legacy D-Plus reflectors and repeaters, you
need to make sure you are authorized to use those systems. They require that you
are a registered user, see www.dstargateway.org for more information. If you are
a registered user, you can enable QnetGateway to used this closed-source system
by DPlus. By default, when QnetLink registers your callsign you will download
both repeaters and reflectors. You can control this with configuration parameters.
You can also control the priority of D-Plus reflectors and repeaters. By default,
QnetLink first loads the gwys.txt file first and then the systems delivered by the
D-Plus Authorization system. You can change the order, if you want definitions
in your gwys.txt file to override any delivered by the D-Plus authorization server.

The information downloaded from the DPlus server is dynamic and will change
from hour to hour. You can update QnetLink by sending "       F" to your system.
This will purge the current table and re-authorize with the DPlus server and
then reload gwys.txt.

Because of the way DPlus authorization works, QnetLink can't actually confirm
that your authorization was successful. If your system is unlinked after trying
to transmit into a DPlus system, it means that your authorization was
unsuccessful. This might indicate that their may be a problem with your
DPlus registration.

If you want to see what's going on inside the programs, there are logging options
available that will cause a lot more log entries. These extra entries can be
useful if you are trying to track down problems with your system.

After you are happy with your configuration, be sure to write it out with the 'w'
key in the main menu. It will show you your qn.cfg file after it writes it out.
After you install and try out your system, you may find that you need to change
some configuration values. In that case just start the configure script again.
It will read the current qn.cfg file when it start and initialize the menus
accordingly.

Of course, you can always build your own qn.cfg file. There are three example for
you to look at:
. qn.everything.cfg contains all parameter with comments about what
  each parameter does. The definitions that are commented out are defined with
  their default value.
. qn.dvap.cfg is the simplest possible configuration for a 2m DVAP. If you have
  a 70cm DVAP rename the module to "b" and change the frequency.
. qn.mmdvm.cfg is the starting place for configuring an MMDVMHost repeater. Be sure
  the module assignment agrees with the module configured in your MMDVM.cfg file.
. qn.itap.cfg is a simple configuration file for Icom's Terminal and Access Point
  Mode. Please note that if you intend on configuring your Icom radio to run in
  Access Point mode, be sure to enable AP mode in your configuration file.

Once you have your qn.cfg file, your ready to compile and install your system, type:

./qnadmin

The first thing you want to do is to create your gwys.txt file. use the 'gw' key
to get into that sub-menu. There are several choices to initialize your gwys.txt
file. Choose one and then you can edit the file to your satisfaction.

If you create a My_Hosts.txt file, it will automatically be appended to the end of
your gwys.txt file. Because it is at the end, definitions in My_Hosts.txt will
override anything defined before. The format for this file is just like gwys.txt:

# comments can begin with a hash mark
# and then: gateway ip_address port
# choose port for linking family (must be supported by the gateway):
#   20001 for DPlus 30001 for DExtra 30051 for DCS.
# Here comes a bogus definition, with the proper format:
Q0XYZ 44.44.44.44 20001

You are now ready to install your QnetGateway system. If you are installing an
MMDVM-based system, follow the instructions in MMDVM.README to get MMDVMHost
up and running.

Now, you can compile and install your system with the 'is' key. qnadmin will
use your qn.cfg file to figure out what needs to be compiled and how it is to
be installed.

If you plan on using DTMF, use the 'id' key to install it. Once you install
something, the qnadmin will dynamically change and show you how to uninstall the
installed items.

The maintenance sub-menu accessed with the 'm' key will let you stop and start
different programs in your installed package. Note that this just uses
systemctl to start and stop a service. It will not uninstall the service.
You might want to do this if you have changed your configuration file.

The log sub-menu accessed with the 'l' key can be use to put a "tail" on different
log files and you can watch a log file in real-time.
